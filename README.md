# Frontend Mentor - Results Summary Component Solution

This project is my solution to the
[Results Summary Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV).

Frontend Mentor challenges are a great way to improve front-end skills by building realistic UI components and focusing on clean, responsive, and accessible code.

## 📌 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
- Experience a clean and responsive UI based on a mobile-first approach

## 🛠 My Process

### ⚙️ Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
- Flexbox (main layout technique)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design principles
- Accessible focus and hover states

---

### 📚 What I Learned

In this project, I worked extensively with **Flexbox** to properly align and position elements across different screen sizes.
I challenged myself to keep the layout clean, structured, and as close as possible to professional front-end standards.

I focused on:

- Writing clean and readable CSS
- Using reusable CSS variables
- Structuring components logically
- Improving hover and focus states for better accessibility

Whenever I encountered issues or unexpected behavior, I used **ChatGPT** as a debugging assistant to better understand my mistakes and fix them correctly. This helped me learn faster and write better code for future projects.

### 🚀 Continued Development

In future updates, I plan to:

- Add smooth and meaningful animations to the UI
- Improve the overall code structure and scalability
- Possibly make the component dynamic using JavaScript and JSON data
- Refactor the project further to match real-world production standards
